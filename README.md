# PasadenaTrafficCollisions
Analyzing traffic collisions in Pasadena

Our code is separated in a few files. The preprocessing and XGBoost model are in mlAnalysis.ipynb. The traffic volume visualization is in GeoVis.ipynb. They can both be executed by running all of the cells in the notebooks. Some packages, like bokeh for example, might have to be downloaded for the code to be run without errors.
