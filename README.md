# PasadenaTrafficCollisions
Analyzing traffic collisions in Pasadena

Our code is separated in a few files. The preprocessing and XGBoost model are in mlAnalysis.ipynb. The traffic volume visualization is in GeoVis.ipynb. They can both be executed by running all of the cells in the notebooks. 


How to run the mlAnalysis.ipynb file:
Open up jupyter notebook to open the file. Each block of code can then be run sequentially. It may be necessary to download some packages so that the first block can import everything necessary.
