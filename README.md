# PasadenaTrafficCollisions
Analyzing traffic collisions in Pasadena

Our code is separated in a few files. The preprocessing and XGBoost model are in mlAnalysis.ipynb. The traffic volume visualization is in GeoVis.ipynb. 

The bulk of our work will be found in GeoVis.ipynb and mlAnalysis.ipynb although we also used the other files for analysis and planning out what we wanted to do in the other files.

# How to run:
Download all of the files in this GitHub repo and place them all in the same folder on your computer locally. All of the .py files and .ipynb files can then be executed by running all of the cells in the notebooks sequentially. Some packages, like bokeh for example, might have to be downloaded for the code to be run without errors.
